# SDT-Project
This project delves into the US vehicle market, culminating in an application hosted on Streamlit via Render. It leverages libraries such as Plotly, Pandas, and Streamlit. Here's a breakdown of its components:

1. Dataset Investigation and Data Preprocessing: This segment involves a brief exploration of the 'vehicles_us.csv' dataset, encompassing tasks like handling missing values and eliminating duplicates. Details can be found in the EDA.ipynb file.

2. Price Slider Creation: Users can utilize a slider to select their desired price range for vehicles.

3. Age Checkbox: A checkbox feature allows users to filter out cars older than 10 years.

4. Scatterplot Visualization: This displays a scatterplot depicting the relationship between price and condition.

5. Model Average Price Histogram: A histogram showcasing the average price distribution across different vehicle models.

Conclusion: The project concludes with insights drawn from the analysis.
